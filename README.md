# Quickie lesson on the command line

*Updated: 2022-01-11*

Main reasons to learn the command-line:

- Some tools are **only** on the command-line, e.g. youtube-dl
- Sometimes, some actions (downloading a file) need to be done with more options and granularity (e.g. `curl -IL`)
- Almost everything ends up being (eventually) more efficient as text+commands vs GUI
- You can create reproducible processes without having to do actual programming
